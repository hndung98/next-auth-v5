# Big Ben - London

Big Ben is probably the world's most famous clock.
That iconic silhouette is instantly recognisable and is one of the most Instagrammed landmarks on the planet.

<br />
Standing tall and proud at the Palace of Westminster, Big Ben serves as one of
London’s most beloved and iconic landmarks. Built in honour of Queen Victoria in
the mid-19th century, the clock still rings every fifteen minutes, keeping
Londoners punctual to this day.

<br />
Although Big Ben is commonly used to refer to the tower as a whole, the nickname
actually refers directly to the clock tower’s largest bell, weighing a
staggering 13.5 long tons. It is believed to have been named after Sir Benjamin
Hall, First Commissioner for Works, whose name is inscribed on the bell.
